        <h3>What is Cybercell?</h3>
        <p>Cybercell is an MMORPG set in a futuristic world. The players have access to a phone in which they can hack other players.
          The most popular feature of Cybercell is the ability to buy and rent housing within the different cities and zones.</p>

        <h3>Budget</h3>
        <p>The cybercell team consists of a few indie developers looking to make the game of their dreams. However, since we are an indie team
          our budget is limited to our crowdfunding and subscription model of Cybercell. However, with the adition of Don Sausage Bacon (our coffee grabber) we can now afford pretty much anything going forward.</p>

        <h3>The player count:</h3>
        <p>Cybercell is happy to boast about its 10,000,000 active subscribers! Every month we have been recieving 200,000 new accounts created! We could have never imagined so many players be playing our game and our servers really show that. Here at Cybercell, we are extremely grateful for having such a great and massive fanbase! To return to our players, we will be giving out FREE subscriptions for 2 months to EVERYONE. Thank you.</p>
    </div>

		<div class="darkBg">
				<h3>Our motivations</h3>
				<p>The motivation to make Cybercell comes from our frustrations with the MMORPG genre. No games out there seem to really hit the spot and most of them seem to be blatant cash grabs or online casinos designed to lure children into spending unreasonable amounts of money.</p>
